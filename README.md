The [less-css-helper-library](https://github.com/code-collabo/less-css-helper-library) for css, less and frontend projects. Related (css) property-value pairs often used together are stored in css classes for easy use, reuse and to help quickly structure your projects. ***Built-in css styles*** are made accessible in your projects just by adding a class to an html element.

The library provides some [reset styles](https://github.com/code-collabo/less-css-helper-library/blob/main/less/01-base/reset.less) and classes which you can apply on html elements.
From the class names, it's easy to tell what they do. Some examples:

* `.block` only sets display to block.
* `.grid` only sets display to grid. 
* `.flex` only sets display to flex.
* `.flex-center` sets display to flex, justify-content and align-items are set to center. 
* `.flex-j-center` only sets display to flex & justify-content to center etc.

You have total control over what the width of the element (and margin in the case of `-auto`) should be. More details & tutorial coming soon on this topic.

## Documentation
For easy maintenance (due to modifications to be made and addition of more features) and also to provide you better support, sections previously included in the readme have been [moved to our docs](https://code-collabo.gitbook.io/docs/) - see [this section of the docs](https://code-collabo.gitbook.io/docs/contributor-guide/docs) in case you also wish to contribute to the docs. Simply click on any of the links to learn to install, use the library in your project and contribute to the library.
#### Using library
* [Styles and classes](https://code-collabo.gitbook.io/docs/user-guide/less-css-helper-library/styles-and-classes)
* [How to use](https://code-collabo.gitbook.io/docs/user-guide/less-css-helper-library/how-to-use)
#### Contributing to library
* See [contributor guide](https://code-collabo.gitbook.io/docs/contributor-guide/contributor-guide) which contains ***contributing.md***, ***CODE_OF_CONDUCT***, ***git workflow*** and ***project development setup*** to help you get started.

The library is maintained by just one person at the moment - [@Ifycode](https://github.com/Ifycode). Meaning that more features will be added only when needed. If you like and have started using the library in your projects but doesn't contain what you need (yet), you can help speed up the process by raising it as an issue or send a pull request.
